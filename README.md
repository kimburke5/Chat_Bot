# Chat_Bot_Project
how to download and run the chatbot and any references you have used.

My name is Kimberly Burke. I am a third year software development student in GMIT. I have created a chat bot based on the Eliza model 
for a module project in Data Representation and Querying. I created the project through Golang programming.

2. To run project, in command prompt 
  go run "eliza-serve.go"

3. To use project in browser go to
